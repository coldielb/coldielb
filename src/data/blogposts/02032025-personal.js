# the grammy awards: a popularity contest in disguise

the grammys and their weird relationship with actually good music. you know what i mean if you've ever been a fan of metal, deathcore, or anything that doesn't fit into their neat little mainstream box.

here's the thing: gojira, one of the most innovative metal bands out there, finally gets some recognition for their olympic performance. it was a massive moment for metal music - millions of people worldwide watching this incredible display of musicianship. but when it comes to the grammys? they get their award backstage, no performance, no spotlight. (*because apparently grinding on the floor is more "appropriate" for primetime tv - looking at you, charli xcx*)

and don't even get me started on the genre confusion. beyonce winning best country album? i mean, i love queen b, but that's like saying i'm a classical pianist because i can play chopsticks. (*i can't even do that*) it's the same energy as when they tried to convince us that post malone was country. next thing you know, they'll be calling drake a jazz artist.

meanwhile, bands like To The Grave are out here dropping absolute masterpieces with meaningful messages, technical complexity, and raw emotion. but apparently, that's too much for the grammy committee to handle. (*maybe they need to turn down their hearing aids*)

but here's the good news. we've got alternatives. take nik nokturnal's metal awards, for example. this dude gets it. it's community-driven, meaning actual fans who know their stuff get to vote. you can choose the best drummer, guitarist, vocalist and other people who actually deserve recognition for their craft. no politics, no popularity contests, just pure appreciation for the art.

the truth is, mainstream award shows have become nothing more than a fancy party where the same group of artists pat each other on the back. (it's basically high school prom for millionaires) while some wins are deserved (*shoutout to kendrick lamar's "not like us"*), the overall system is about as genuine as a three-dollar bill.

so maybe it's time we stop giving these big award shows so much power. let's support the smaller venues, the community-driven awards, the places where real music gets the recognition it deserves. because at the end of the day, i'd rather watch a genuine celebration of music than another overproduced popularity contest.

(*and hey, grammy committee, if you're reading this - it wouldn't kill you to let a deathcore band perform. the world won't end if people hear a blast beat on national television*)
