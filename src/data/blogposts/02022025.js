  title: "Let's Talk About Self-Care",
  content: `# let's talk about self-care

hey everyone, switching things up today. usually i'm here talking about code and tech, but sometimes we need to talk about the other stuff too. i've been thinking a lot about self-care lately, and i want to share some thoughts. *(warning: no technical jargon ahead)*

let's talk about self-care. and before you roll your eyes and picture a montage of candles and someone journaling with their $12 matcha latte, hear me out. self-care isn't just about pampering yourself. it's about doing the things that keep you from becoming a complete dumpster fire. and that's a lot harder than it sounds.

society has made a mess of the whole concept. on one hand, we're bombarded with instagram influencers telling us to "romanticize our lives" and buy overpriced bath salts. on the other, there's still this weird stigma around actually doing the work to take care of yourself. therapy? taboo. taking a mental health day? weak. setting boundaries? rude.

it's like society is screaming at us to take care of ourselves while simultaneously handing us a list of reasons why we shouldn't. even now, with therapy apps and meditation podcasts flooding every ad break, self-care is still something people whisper about, like it's this shameful secret.

let's be real: how many people casually bring up their therapy sessions without immediately adding a disclaimer? *(yeah, i'm in therapy... but just for stress, nothing serious!)* heaven forbid someone admits they're working on themselves without trying to downplay it.

here's the truth: self-care isn't indulgent. it's survival. it's doing the boring, unglamorous things that keep you from spiraling - like getting enough sleep, drinking water, and occasionally eating a vegetable that didn't come from a deep fryer. it's also about recognizing when you need help and actually seeking it, even if it feels uncomfortable.

for me, self-care has always been a struggle. i'm not naturally wired to put myself first. i'm more of a "power through it and hope for the best" kind of person, which works great until it doesn't. there have been plenty of times when i've ignored the warning signs - exhaustion, burnout, that nagging voice telling me to take a break - only to crash and burn spectacularly later.

sometimes, self-care looks like doing the dishes after three days of convincing yourself they'll magically wash themselves. sometimes, it's canceling plans because you know you're running on fumes. and sometimes, it's staring at a wall in therapy for an hour, trying to figure out why you can't let go of that one thing someone said to you in sixth grade.

but the hardest part? letting go of the guilt. we've been conditioned to think that taking care of ourselves is selfish, like every moment we spend on self-care is a moment we're not being productive. here's the thing: you can't pour from an empty cup. if you're running on empty, you're not helping anyone.

so here's my unsolicited self-care advice:

1. start small: you don't need to overhaul your life overnight. drink water. go for a walk. take five minutes to breathe. baby steps are still steps.

2. normalize therapy: seriously, just do it. everyone's got their thing, and talking to someone who gets it is worth every penny.

3. set boundaries: saying "no" isn't rude; it's necessary.

4. unplug occasionally: if you're doomscrolling at 2am, no amount of bath bombs is going to save you.

5. celebrate the little wins: did you finally call the dentist? amazing. clean your room? incredible. be your own hype person.

self-care isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. it's messy, imperfect, and different for everyone. but if there's one thing i've learned, it's that taking care of yourself isn't a luxury - it's a necessity.

# on loss and moving forward

loss is one of those things nobody wants to talk about but everyone eventually faces. it doesn't care who you are, where you're from, or what your plans for the week were. it's going to show up, uninvited, and leave you changed.

for me, loss has been a constant companion, shaping not just my ability to cope, but also the way i see the world. *(spoiler: it hasn't been pretty)*

the first real loss i experienced was when i was nine and my grandma passed away. i was too young to fully understand what it meant, but i remember the overwhelming sense of absence - this weird, heavy emptiness that followed me everywhere.

not long after, my brother was hospitalized. i don't remember the specifics of his illness, but i remember the terror. the thought of losing him so soon after losing my grandma was too much for my young brain to handle. it felt like the world was spinning out of control, and there was nothing i could do to stop it.

then there were my dogs. buster passed away during my sophomore year of high school, right in the middle of the chaos that was COVID-19. a year later, rusty followed. they were old pups, but that didn't make it any easier. watching them deteriorate - seeing their energy fade and their bodies fail them - broke me in ways i hadn't anticipated.

i cried until i physically couldn't anymore. then i got up and moved forward, because what else was there to do? life didn't pause for me to grieve.

in 2023, my other grandma passed away. this time, i didn't cry. maybe it was because we didn't spend as much time with that side of the family, or maybe it was because i'd grown numb to loss. either way, i felt a wave of regret. i couldn't help but think of all the times i could have visited, called, or made an effort, but didn't.

loss is funny that way. it doesn't give you a clear roadmap for how to feel or what to do. it just happens, and you're left to figure it out on your own. for me, breaking down never felt like the answer. crying, mourning, and wallowing in the pain all felt like they prolonged the inevitable: moving on.

but the thing about "moving on" is that it's not as clean or simple as it sounds. memories fade, and that's its own kind of loss. i can still remember random things - license plates, phone numbers, the lyrics to songs i haven't heard in years. but the memories of my grandparents? they're slipping away. i can't fully recall the times i went to the zoo with my abuelita or played soccer at their house.

and then there's my abuelito, my last living grandparent. when i see him, i can't help but wonder how i'll react when his time eventually comes. will i finally snap under the weight of all the losses i've never fully processed? will i crumble, realizing i've been carrying years of unresolved grief? or will i do what i've always done - push forward, pretending i'm fine because it feels easier than confronting the pain?

that's why self-care matters so much. looking back, i wish i'd had someone outside of my family to guide me through those moments. someone who could have helped me navigate the grief and shown me that it's okay to fall apart for a while.

loss is a painful teacher. it doesn't wait for you to be ready or give you a choice in the matter. but if there's one thing i've learned, it's that coping doesn't mean ignoring the pain. it means finding a way to live with it, even when it feels unbearable.

# the art of giving advice (and maybe taking it too)

i've always considered myself pretty great at giving advice. honestly, it's not that hard - just listen to the person in front of you in a genuine way and then whip out what i call the sandwich. no, not the kind you eat. *(though let's be real, sandwiches are amazing and deserve their own blog post)*

this sandwich is a foolproof formula for giving solid advice, and here's how it works:

step 1: acknowledge their feelings
first, you validate their emotions. whether you agree with them or not, how someone feels is always valid. they're mad? fine. they're sad? fine. they're still upset about Game of Thrones in 2024? still fine. the key here is making sure they know you're on their side emotionally, even if their logic isn't making sense.

step 2: create a tangible plan
next, you help them figure out a way forward. not "let's plan a trip to vegas and forget about it all," but something grounded in reality. a plan that takes baby steps, actionable goals, and creates a clear path out of whatever rut they're stuck in.

step 3: call out their bs
here's the fun part: you get to gently (or not-so-gently) call them out. this is where you say, "look, i get that this sucks, but wallowing in self-pity isn't going to fix it." the goal isn't to tear them down; it's to shake them out of their funk just enough to help them see a way forward.

step 4: acknowledge their feelings again
finally, you circle back to validation. after all the tough love, you need to remind them that it's okay to feel what they're feeling. acknowledge that their struggle is real, and make sure they leave the conversation feeling seen and supported.

the key to giving good advice is empathy. and let's be honest, empathy is in short supply these days. now, here's where it gets tricky: part of self-care is actually listening to your own advice. and that is so much harder than it sounds.

having a friend to keep you in check can help. not only does it show that someone cares enough to call you out, but it also proves your advice was so good, you managed to ignore it entirely.

the truth is, self-care isn't a solo project. sure, it starts with you, but it doesn't have to end there. having a support system - friends, family, even a therapist - can make all the difference. because trying to fix yourself in a vacuum is exhausting. sometimes, you need someone to hand you a flashlight and remind you that you're not wandering around in the dark alone.

find some friends who actually care about you, hold each other accountable, and maybe even eat some real sandwiches while you're at it. because at the end of the day, taking care of yourself doesn't just make you better - it makes life better.
