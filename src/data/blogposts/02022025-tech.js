  # thoughts on o3-mini and the state of AI benchmarking

  i've been sitting on this post for a bit, trying to gather my thoughts about OpenAI's latest release. honestly, there's a lot to unpack here, both good and bad.

  o3-mini dropped recently and while everyone's hyped about the improvements, i think we need to talk about some deeper issues in the AI space. (*and no, this isn't just another hot take*)

  let's start with what o3-mini actually is. it follows the o1 and o1-mini releases, which were pretty revolutionary when they came out. the big innovation was letting models take more time to process before outputting anything. simple concept, but it worked surprisingly well. the quality jump was noticeable, and it seemed like we were heading in an interesting direction.

  but here's where i start having concerns. fundamentally, these models are still based on transformer architecture. they're still doing the same token prediction game, just with extra processing time. sure, the results are better, but are we actually innovating or just refining the same approach? (*it's like putting racing stripes on a car and calling it a new model*)

  this brings me to something i've been thinking about a lot lately - what i'm calling the benchmarking paradox. every time a new model drops, the first thing everyone looks at is the benchmark scores. how does it perform on SWE-Bench? what about FrontierMath? and i get it, we need some way to measure progress.

  but here's the problem - the more we focus on benchmark performance, the more these models are optimized for these specific tests rather than real-world applications. it's creating this weird situation where models might ace every benchmark but still struggle with practical, everyday tasks. (*like that straight-A student who can't figure out how to do their own laundry*)

  speaking of benchmarks, there's some interesting drama going on with OpenAI. word is they might have reached out to EpochAI to get info about the FrontierMath Benchmark. now, this isn't confirmed, but if it's true, it's pretty concerning. o3 is scoring around 20% on these benchmarks while other models are under 10%. on the surface, that looks impressive. but if they had inside access to the benchmark data? that changes everything about how we should interpret those scores.

  this ties into a bigger issue with OpenAI's overall approach. they've become increasingly closed off, which feels like it goes against everything "Open" AI should stand for. (*irony, anyone?*)

  now, i've been using both o3-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet extensively in my development workflow. sonnet just feels different. it's hard to quantify, but there's a responsiveness and personality there that o3-mini lacks. when i'm coding, i actually use both - o3-mini as an architect model and sonnet as my main driver in Aider. it's a setup that works really well for my needs.

  but here's what really gets me thinking - the developer ecosystem that's forming around these models. pretty much every AI company now offers OpenAI-compatible APIs. it's become the de facto standard. and while that's great for compatibility, it creates this situation where there's little incentive to try alternatives. OpenAI's models are cheap, readily available, and can handle most tasks reasonably well. why would developers look elsewhere?

  this is putting immense pressure on other AI companies. they're not just competing on model performance anymore - they're fighting against an entire ecosystem that's built around OpenAI's architecture. (*it's like trying to launch a new social media platform when everyone's already on instagram*)

  the real issue is that we can't really quantify what makes an AI model "good" in real-world applications. benchmarks don't capture the nuances of actual development work. they don't show how well a model understands context, maintains consistency, or adapts to unique problem-solving situations. but since we can't easily measure these qualities, we default to benchmark scores.

  i'm not saying benchmarks are useless. they serve a purpose in giving us some way to measure progress. but when they become the primary goal rather than a tool for evaluation, we end up optimizing for the wrong things. it's like teaching to the test instead of teaching for understanding.

  after using o3-mini for a while now, i can say it's definitely an improvement over o1. the outputs are more consistent, the reasoning is clearer, and it handles complex tasks better. but i still find myself gravitating toward sonnet for most of my work. there's just something about how it approaches problems that feels more aligned with how i think.

  i think we're at an interesting crossroads in AI development. we need to figure out better ways to evaluate these models that don't just rely on benchmark scores. we need to think about what actually matters in real-world applications and how to measure that effectively.

  in my next post, i'll dive deeper into my Aider workflow and how i'm using these models in practical development scenarios. i think that's where the real interesting stuff is - not in benchmark scores, but in how these tools actually help us build better software.

  (*and yeah, i know this post got a bit ranty, but sometimes you gotta call it like you see it*)
