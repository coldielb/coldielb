You wake with a start, heart pounding against your ribs like a trapped bird. The alarm clock screams its digital cry across your bedroom… 7:15 AM. You're late. Again.

"Shit," you mutter, kicking off tangled sheets. Mom's going to lose it.

The house is already alive with morning chaos when you stumble downstairs, hair uncombed, backpack half-zipped with last night's unfinished math homework crumpled inside. Your little sister sits at the kitchen table, perfectly ready as always, spooning cereal into her mouth while scrolling through her phone.

"Well, look who finally decided to join the living," Mom says, not looking up from packing lunches. Her voice carries that edge. The one that means you're walking on thin ice. "You promised you'd be up early today."

"My alarm didn't go off right," you lie, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl.

"Your alarm works fine. Your ability to listen to it is the problem." She slams a lunch bag on the counter in front of you. "This is the third time this week, Ryan."

You bite back the words forming on your tongue. What's the point? She wouldn't understand anyway. Nobody does. How could they? How could anyone understand that sometimes the weight of getting up, of facing another day at school, feels like trying to swim through concrete?

Your father walks in, already dressed for work, his tie perfectly knotted. Always perfect, always on time. "Still not ready?" he asks, eyebrows raised. "Bus leaves in ten minutes."

"I know what time the bus leaves," you snap.

The kitchen falls silent. Your sister looks up from her phone, eyes wide.

"Don't you dare speak to me in that tone," your father says, voice dangerously low. "After everything your mother and I do for you…”

"What? What do you do exactly? Work all day? Never listen? Act like getting straight A's is the only thing that matters in the entire universe?"

You hadn't meant to say it, not all of it, anyway. But once the words start, they spill out like water through broken glass.

Your father's face hardens. "Give me your phone."

“What?! No…“

"Now, Ryan. You're grounded. One week. Maybe that'll give you time to think about respect."

You slam your backpack onto the floor. "This is such bullshit!"

"Two weeks," he counters, hand extended. "Phone. Now."

You rip the phone from your pocket, slap it into his palm with more force than necessary, and grab your backpack.

"Ryan, wait…” your mother starts.

But you're already yanking open the front door, stepping out into the crisp morning air. You hear her calling after you, but you keep walking, hands shoved deep in your pockets, shoulders hunched against the bite of wind and the weight of unfairness.

The bus rumbles away from the curb just as you reach the stop. Perfect. Just perfect.

By the time you walk to school, first period is already half over. Mr. Sanchez gives you a disappointed look when you slip into your desk, but doesn't stop his lecture on cell division. Small mercies.

The morning crawls by. You doodle through English, nod off during History, and nearly get sent to the principal during Chemistry when Ms. Patterson catches you texting Jenny, until she realizes you don't have your phone, and it's actually Luke two seats over.

At lunch, you sit with your usual group, picking at the sandwich your mom made. Turkey. Again. Like every Monday for the past three years.

"Dude, you look like shit," Luke says, dropping onto the bench beside you.

"Thanks," you mutter. "Just what I needed to hear."

"Parents giving you grief again?"

You nod, tearing off a piece of crust and rolling it between your fingers. "Dad took my phone for two weeks."

Luke winces. "Harsh."

"Whatever. It's not like there's anything worth seeing on it anyway." You glance across the cafeteria where Jenny sits with her friends, laughing at something. She hasn't texted you in three days.

"You coming to practice after school?" Luke asks, following your gaze.

"Can't. Dad's probably called Coach already to let him know I'm grounded from that too."

The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. Students begin shuffling toward the exit, dumping trays, checking phones. Just another day in the endless parade of days that make up high school. You gather your things slowly. Fifth period is Math with Mr. Kendrick, and you still haven't finished the homework.

The hallway is crowded, bodies pressing against each other in the rush to next period. You feel disconnected from it all, like you're watching the scene through thick glass. These people with their normal problems and everyday dramas, they have no idea how small it all is. How meaningless.

You're nearly at your locker when the first sound cuts through the hallway chatter.

A bang.

Many students don't even register it at first. Could be a door slamming. A book dropping. Someone's prank.

Then another. Louder. Unmistakable.

For one eternal second, the hallway freezes. Two hundred bodies suspended in disbelief.

Then, chaos.

Screams erupt from the west corridor. Bodies begin to move, first in confusion, then in terror. Someone shoves past you, knocking you into the lockers. A girl is crying. A teacher emerges from a classroom, face pale, trying to herd students inside.

"LOCKDOWN! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!" The PA system crackles to life, the principal's voice strained and high. "ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF INITIATE LOCKDOWN PROCEDURES IMMEDIATELY!"

More shots. Closer now.

You can't move. Your feet feel bolted to the floor even as students rush past you in all directions. This isn't happening. Can't be happening. Not here. Not today.

But it is.

Through the thinning crowd, at the far end of the hallway, a figure appears. You can't make out their face, just the dark shape of them. And something in their hands.

Someone grabs your arm, Mr. Kendrick, pulling you toward his classroom.

"Come on!" he shouts over the alarms now blaring through the school. "We need to get inside!"

You stumble after him, through the doorway where other students are already pushing desks against the door, hiding under tables, some sobbing, some eerily silent. Mr. Kendrick locks the door, kills the lights, herds everyone to the far wall away from windows.

You pull out your phone to call home, to call anyone… but your pocket is empty. Your phone is sitting on your father's desk at home, punishment for this morning's disrespect.

The irony doesn't escape you.

Gunshots echo down the hallway, punctuated by screams. Closer now. The classroom is silent except for muffled crying and the sound of thirty people trying not to breathe too loudly.

You think of your mother, of how you stormed out this morning without saying goodbye. Of your father, and how your last words to him were angry ones. Of your little sister, who might be in a classroom just like this one right now, terrified.

Would they know you loved them, if this was it? Would they know that beneath all the teen angst and rebellion, they were your world?

You close your eyes, back pressed against the cold wall, and find yourself doing something you haven't done in years: praying. Not to any god in particular, just to whatever might be listening.

Please. Please. Not today. Not us.

Footsteps in the hall. Heavy. Purposeful. Stopping outside doors, checking handles. Moving on when they find them locked.

Getting closer.

Mr. Kendrick puts a finger to his lips, though no one is making a sound. You could hear a pin drop in the room. The only noise is the blood rushing in your ears, the desperate hammer of your heart.

The footsteps stop outside your door.

The handle jiggles.

The wood creaks under pressure.

Then…

A bang so loud it feels like the world has split open, and you feel a sudden, strange heat spreading across your chest…

…

**Author's Note**
<br>
<em>Every day in America, 125 people are killed with guns. Twice as many are shot and wounded, and countless others are impacted by acts of gun violence.

In 2024, there have been at least 160 occurrences of gunfire on school grounds, resulting in 46 deaths and 106 injuries nationally. The 2023-2024 school year saw 144 incidents of gunfire on school grounds, a 31 percent increase from the prior school year.

These aren't just numbers. These are people's lives that have been forever impacted by gunfire on school grounds, the last place they should have to worry about violence of any kind.

Our children deserve to go to class free from the threat of gun violence. Their biggest concern should be finding the right classroom, not the closest exit.

We all are born with infinite potential. Those who fail to protect that potential and who choose inaction and empty words over meaningful change—will be remembered in history not just as those who failed us, but as those who watched our future bleed away, one classroom at a time.
