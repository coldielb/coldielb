# An Offering

So I had this idea. I've got this pretty decent desktop setup that's just sitting around most of the time, and I figured why not let people use some of that space?

## What I'm thinking

Basically, I'm gonna open up my computer for hosting small projects. Discord bots, personal websites, blogs, whatever. Just the kind of stuff that doesn't need some crazy enterprise setup but still needs somewhere reliable-ish to live online.

I got tired of seeing friends lose their projects when free tiers expired or prices suddenly jumped. Or those annoying services that start free then hit you with the "upgrade now to continue" after you've already put work in. So frustrating.

## My Setup

I am going to be completely transparent about what this is. This isn't some fancy datacenter or even a dedicated server. It's literally just my desktop computer sitting in my house in California, collecting dust. 

What this means for you: When my power goes out (and it does with high winds and whatnot), your stuff goes offline, No backup generators, no redundancy systems, I reboot for updates about once a week, so expect brief downtime, California wildfires, power shutoffs, and earthquakes are real things that happen here, My internet is good but not business-grade

I'm not making any uptime guarantees because I honestly can't. Some months might be 99% uptime, others might be worse if we get hit with rolling blackouts or I need to evacuate (it's happened before and its scary, so unfortunately your data is not my priority).

I'll do my absolute best to keep things running smoothly, but you should know exactly what you're getting into. If you need guaranteed uptime for something important, this probably isn't for you. But for hobby projects, personal sites, and things where occasional downtime isn't the end of the world? We're good.

## How it works

It's free. Like, actually free. free free free free free free. I'm not trying to build some stupid startup here or attract investors (but i do want money so i might set up a donation thingy). I just have resources I'm not using and figured why not share them.

I'll keep hosting stuff until I run out of allocated space (will start at 250GB) or computing power. Once that happens, I'll stop taking in new projects, but I'll keep the existing ones going as long as I can.

There's no catch here. No premium tier. No "basic features only" nonsense. Just free hosting until I physically can't host anymore.

## Why am I doing this?

Honestly, partly because I can, and partly because I think the internet has gotten kind of lame with everything behind paywalls and subscription services. 

Remember when people just made cool stuff and put it online without worrying about monetization strategies? I miss that internet (yall might be too young to remember that era. its even a bit too old for me).

Plus, it's a fun project for me. I get to tinker with my setup, learn some new stuff about hosting, and hopefully help some people get their projects online without dealing with the usual headaches. Plus another notch on my resume is a bonus.

## When's this happening?

I'm aiming to get this going in May 2025 but may be more towards like mid-May or even late May depending on how good i am at figuring this out. Need some time to set up the backend stuff, figure out security, make sure I'm not opening myself up to anything crazy.

I don't know how long I'll be able to keep this running. Hardware dies, circumstances change. But I'm going to try to keep it going as long as possible for anyone who gets in. Migrations are real and I will do my best to ensure that you can migrate with me.

## Final Words

If you've got something small you want hosted and don't want to deal with all the cloud BS, hit me up when this launches in May. It's not fancy, but it'll get the job done.

But yeah, a free hosting service? What a refresher. Coming May 2025.
