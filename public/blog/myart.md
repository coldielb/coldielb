# My Journey Back to Post-Human Dystopian Art

There's something profoundly personal about returning to an artistic practice you've set aside. Like rediscovering an old friend, it feels both familiar and strange; the muscle memory remains, but the relationship has changed profoundly.

My journey with art began in 6th grade, continuing through early high school before I pivoted toward computer science. It's a familiar story for many of us with technical minds and creative spirits; that fork in the road where we choose between seemingly disparate paths. Engineering called louder than art school, and I followed.

But here's what I've learned: these paths aren't truly separate. The systematic thinking that makes me effective in ECE complements rather than conflicts with my artistic expression. In fact, that technical foundation gives me unique perspectives to bring to my post-human dystopian landscapes.

## My Aesthetic

My artistic style exists in that captivating intersection between precision and a mess. I lovingly call it "chicken scratch mixed with coherent lines." It's reminiscent of those haunting scenes from one of my favorite movies "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" and "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes," where nature reclaims abandoned human structures. There's something mesmerizing about visualizing real places transformed by ecological succession after humanity's hypothetical disappearance.

## The One-Shot Philosophy

What makes this approach particularly compelling is my "one-shot" methodology. Everything executed in pen, no do-overs, white-outs, or hidden mistakes. Complete transparency in the process and embracing imperfections as part of the narrative.

This approach not only creates a distinctive visual texture but also embodies a philosophical stance about impermanence and adaptation (themes central to post-human dystopian art). The permanence of ink forces deliberate decision-making while allowing room for organic development.

## The Digital Extension

While the core work happens analogically, I've developed a streamlined post-production workflow. Scanning the raw pen work, using Photopea for touch-ups, adding a digital signature and date stamp, while preserving the physical work in its clean, signature-less state.

## The Separate Creative Universe: Digital Art

Entirely separate from my pen-and-paper dystopian landscapes lives my digital art practice. These projects represent a completely different creative headspace â€“ cute designs and concepts that contrast sharply with the post-apocalyptic themes of my traditional work.

These two artistic practices don't intersect or inform each other, they're distinct channels for different parts of my creative identity. The raw, unforgiving nature of pen work speaks to my fascination with decay and rebirth, while digital art allows for exploration of lighter themes and aesthetic playfulness.

## The Art Tab Beckons

With a dedicated space planned for sharing these creations, the accountability structure is in place. There's something powerful about declaring artistic intentions publicly, it transforms personal exploration into a committed practice.

For fellow returners to artistic practice, remember that the time away wasn't wasted, it was gathering experiences and perspectives that will now enrich your work. The technical skills developed in other domains become unexpected tools in your creative arsenal.

The canvas awaits. Let's see what emerges from those chicken scratches and coherent lines.
