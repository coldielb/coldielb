# An Impressive New Contender in Systems Programming

Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental was recently released, and after putting it through its paces in a series of rigorous tests focusing on systems programming languages, I am genuinely impressed by what this model brings to the table. (Just on the surface Gemini has shown its colors, but further testing is needed).

## The New Thinking Model

Gemini 2.5 Pro represents an evolution in Google's AI strategy. Unlike its predecessors, it's built as a "thinking model" from the ground up (rather than tossing reasoning on top of an already exceptional model), capable of reasoning through problems before generating responses. This approach allows for enhanced performance and improved accuracy across a variety of tasks like coding, math, science, or any subject with verifiable rewards.

What makes Gemini particularly interesting is how Google has integrated reasoning capabilities directly into the model architecture. As Dr. Shohei Harase from Google DeepMind explains, this isn't just about classification and prediction, it's about enabling the AI to "analyze information, draw logical conclusions, incorporate context and nuance, and make informed decisions." This fundamental shift in design philosophy is already paying dividends in practical applications.

## Benchmark Performance

I've been developing a specialized benchmark focused specifically on systems programming languages like Rust, Go, C, C++, and Assembly. These languages form the backbone of performance-critical software and present unique challenges for AI models due to their strict typing, memory management requirements, and low-level operations.

My benchmark consists of 13 hand crafted problems designed to test a model's ability to generate correct and functional code. Each problem has a clear, verifiable outcome and it covers various aspects of systems programming. Here's the results:

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 3 solved (0-shot); 6 solved total (multi-shot)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (No Thinking): 3 solved (0-shot); 4 solved total (multi-shot)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking): 2 solved (0-shot); 5 solved total (multi-shot)
- o3-mini-high: 3 solved (0-shot); 4 solved total (multi-shot)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New): 0 solved (0-shot); 2 solved total (multi-shot)
- Gemini Flash 2.0 (No Thinking): 1 solved (0-shot); 2 solved total (multi-shot)
- Gemini Flash 2.0 (Thinking Exp): 1 solved (0-shot); 1 solved total (multi-shot)
- DeepSeek R1: 2 solved (0-shot); 2 solved total (multi-shot)
- DeepSeek v3: 0 solved (0-shot); 1 solved total (multi-shot)
- DeepSeek v3 0324: 0 solved (0-shot); 1 solved total (multi-shot)
- GPT-4o: 0 solved (0-shot); 0 solved total (multi-shot)

For context, "0-shot" refers to how many problems the model solved on its first attempt without any additional prompting, while "multi-shot" allows for up to 5 additional opportunities to fix errors or retry the problem. Not every model has to use all 5 attempts for a problem, but none were allowed to proceed to the next problem until either solving it or exhausting all 5 opportunities.

Gemini 2.5 Pro tied for most problems solved on the first attempt and led the pack in total problems solved after multiple attempts. This puts it on par with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o3-mini-high, but with a slight edge in overall performance.

## Technical Capabilities and Architecture

What makes Gemini 2.5 Pro particularly suited for handling systems languages? Several architectural choices contribute to its strong performance.

First, its 1 million token context window (with 2 million coming soon) enables the model to process and understand vast amounts of information. This is especially valuable when working with complex codebases or when needing to reference documentation while generating code.

Second, its multimodal capabilities allow it to process and understand information across different formatsâ€”text, audio, images, video, and even entire code repositories. This means you can show the model diagrams, screenshots of error messages, or code snippets, and it can incorporate this visual information into its reasoning process.

Finally, the built-in thinking mechanisms enable Gemini 2.5 Pro to reason through complex programming challenges step by step, similar to how an experienced developer might approach a problem. This is particularly valuable in systems programming, where seemingly minor errors can have catastrophic consequences.

It also helps to mention that Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Exp was the previous leader of the pack in my benchmark showing noticeable improvement on its already powerful performance.

## Real-World Applications

The strong performance in systems languages opens up exciting possibilities for practical applications:

1. **Systems-Level Development Assistance**: Engineers working on operating systems, device drivers, or embedded systems can leverage the model for code generation, debugging, and optimization.

2. **Legacy Code Modernization**: Organizations with legacy codebases in C or C++ can use the model to help refactor and update their code to modern standards.

3. **Educational Tool**: Students learning systems programming can use the model to understand complex concepts, get help with debugging, and see alternative implementations, although as mentioned in a previous post here, I would heavily discourage new programmers from utilising AI to code for you, versus with you.

4. **Cross-Language Translation**: Developers can use the model to help port code between different systems languages, maintaining performance characteristics while adapting to language-specific idioms.

## How Does It Compare to Claude and Other Models?

While Gemini 2.5 Pro showed impressive results, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o3-mini-high were close competitors, indicating Gemini may have had luck on its side. Each model seems to have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific programming task.

Claude excels at understanding nuanced instructions and generating well-documented code, while Gemini appears to have a slight edge in solving the most challenging systems programming problems. The performance gap between these top models and the rest of the field is quite significant, suggesting that we're seeing a new tier of capability emerge in AI coding assistants.

Interestingly, models with thinking capabilities generally outperformed their non-thinking counterparts when given multiple attempts to solve a problem. This suggests that the ability to reason through errors and refine approaches is becoming increasingly valuable in complex programming tasks. However, it's important to mention some caveats to this. For example day to day use of Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) yields some interesting outputs where the benchmark doesn't show that nuance. o3-mini-high also has some hallucination issues with day to day usage, but again the benchmark doesnt reflect this.

## Pricing and Accessibility

While Google hasn't released official pricing for Gemini 2.5 Pro yet (it's coming in the next few weeks), it's worth noting that it's already available for Gemini Advanced subscribers through the model dropdown in the Gemini app on both desktop and mobile.

Developers can also start experimenting with it immediately through Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI support coming soon. This widespread availability, combined with the promise of "higher rate limits for scaled production use," suggests that Google is positioning Gemini 2.5 Pro as a serious contender for enterprise-level AI development assistance.

## Final Thoughts

Based on my benchmark results and hands-on testing, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental represents a significant step forward for AI-assisted systems programming. Its strong performance across Rust, Go, C, C++, and Assembly demonstrates versatility that few other models can match.

For developers working with these languages, Gemini 2.5 Pro offers a compelling alternative to OpenAI's offerings at what will likely be a more competitive price point. The integration of reasoning capabilities directly into the model architecture pays dividends when tackling complex programming challenges, and the expansive context window enables more comprehensive analysis of large codebases.

As my benchmark expands to include more problems and languages in the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see if Gemini 2.5 Pro can maintain its position at the top of the leaderboard. For now, it's established itself as a serious contender in the AI coding assistant space, particularly for those working with systems programming languages. I also want to allow for sequential benchmarks (e.g. solve part a to solve part b), as I am interested to see how models perform there.

Whether you're a professional developer, a computer science student, or just someone interested in low-level programming, Gemini 2.5 Pro is definitely worth exploring if you have $19.99 (I believe Google offers a free month). Its combination of reasoning capabilities, technical accuracy, and broad language support makes it one of the most capable AI assistants available for systems programming today.
